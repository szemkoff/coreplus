## Manufacturing Process

<div className="image-container">
  <img src="/coreplus/img/layouts/max_size_module_layout.png" alt="Manufacturing Process" />
</div>

Our panels are manufactured in a controlled factory environment using the following process:

1. **Material Preparation** - Core and facing materials are cut to precise dimensions
2. **Assembly** - Facing materials are bonded to the core under heat and pressure
3. **Curing** - Panels undergo controlled curing for maximum strength
4. **Integration** - Electrical, plumbing, and HVAC components are integrated
5. **Finishing** - Exterior and interior finishes are applied as specified
6. **Quality Control** - Each panel undergoes comprehensive testing
7. **Packaging** - Panels are protected for transport to the construction site

## Quality Control

Every panel undergoes rigorous testing before leaving our facility:

- **Dimensional Accuracy** - Laser measurement ensures precise dimensions
- **Structural Testing** - Load testing verifies structural integrity
- **Thermal Imaging** - Identifies any insulation gaps or thermal bridges
- **Weather Resistance** - Water and air infiltration testing
- **Connection Testing** - Verifies the integrity of all connection points
