## Module Layouts

### Base Module Layout
![Floor Layout Overview](/img/layouts/floor_layout.png)

Our standard floor layout provides the foundation for all modular configurations.

### Single Module
![Single Module Layout](/img/layouts/single_module_layout.png)

The single module configuration is perfect for small-scale applications and can be used as a standalone unit or combined with additional modules.

### Optimal Module
